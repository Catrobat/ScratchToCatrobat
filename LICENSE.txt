Licenses of the Catrobat system

The following licenses, terms, and conditions apply to your use of the Catrobat system:
Version 3.5, 28 January 2015
All source code of software constituting the Catrobat system, e.g., the integrated development environments (with all associated parts such as tutorial programs) and the interpreters and compilers for the Catrobat programming language, the image editing programs, the source code of software we wrote to run the Catrobat websites and other Internet resources, and all our own source code related to the Catrobat system, are free software: you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version when it becomes available.

The names and logos of the Catrobat project and subprojects are copyrighted by and trademarks of the Catrobat project and cannot be used in derivative work. You are however allowed to use the names and logos of Catrobat, Catroid, Catty, Pocket Code, Paintroid, Pocket Paint, and other names and logos of software created by the Catrobat team in non-derivative work such as, e.g., books, brochures, or descriptive web pages. We do ask to include a note that either says "Catrobat is developed by the Catrobat project http://developer.catrobat.org/" or "Catrobat makes it easy to program your own interactive stories, games, and animations --- and share your creations on the web. As you create and share Catrobat programs, you learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. All parts of the Catrobat system are developed by the Catrobat project. They are available as free open source software from http://developer.catrobat.org/".

For the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running a Catrobat program, e.g., the interpreters, the GNU Affero General Public License is supplemented by an additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the License. This exception allows you to convey a runtime version of a program written in the Catrobat programming language, for which you otherwise legally hold the necessary rights, in combination with the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running that Catrobat program, under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the independent parts of the corresponding Catrobat program.

Please note that this is only possible either when you are the sole creator of the program including all its parts such as graphics, texts, sounds, etc, or in case you licensed the parts of other programs on which your program is based upon, including any additional material and/or possible trademarks etc, in such a way that you are allowed to convey the resulting software under your chosen terms in consistence with these third-party materials. This additional permission is similar to the additional permission for GCC (see the corresponding Rationale and FAQ page for the exception for GCC for more information). If the work thus created has an interactive user interface, it must display a note in a screen shown when the user presses an "About" menu button or a similar way to convey such a message that says "This work was created using programs developed by the Catrobat project. Catrobat makes it easy to program your own interactive stories, games, and animations --- and share your creations on the web. As you create and share programs with Catrobat, you learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Catrobat is available as free open source software from http://developer.catrobat.org/ and is distributed by the Catrobat project under the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version when it becomes available. For the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running a Catrobat program, e.g., the Catrobat Interpreter, the GNU Affero General Public License is supplemented by an additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the License. This exception allows to convey a runtime version of a Catrobat program, for which you otherwise legally hold the necessary rights, in combination with the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running that Catrobat program, under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the independent parts of the corresponding Catrobat program.". The same notice must also be added by you as text in or along any documents you distribute together with your runtime version of the program. Please consult our Catrobat License Additional Term page for the precise legal formulation of the additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. For clarification, note that this additional permission does not apply to programs you upload to Catrobat's website. Please consult https://pocketcode.org/termsOfUse for the terms and http://developer.catrobat.org/licenses_of_uploaded_catrobat_programs for the precise legal terms and conditions that apply to a project you upload to Catrobat's website.

Please also note that by using or visiting any website (including any software that we created which either runs directly on our servers, or alternatively runs client-side, e.g., in your browser, but is served by our servers) or products (including all our web-services provided by software that we created which are offered through our servers), all executables we offer on any markets or the web (including, e.g., the Google Play App Store, Apple's iTunes App Store, Amazon's App Store, Microsoft's Windows Phone Apps Store, etc), data feeds, and services provided to you on, from, or through the Catrobat project (collectively the "Service"), you signify your agreement to (1) Catrobat's terms and conditions (the "Terms of Use and Service", found at http://developer.catrobat.org/terms_of_use_and_service), (2) Catrobat's privacy notice (found at http://developer.catrobat.org/privacy_policy), and (3) Catrobat's Community Guidelines (found at https://pocketcode.org/termsOfUse). If you do not agree to any of these terms, the Catrobat privacy notice, or the Community Guidelines, please do not use the Service.

All non-software artefacts of the Catrobat system created by us, such as, e.g., text, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features, and other materials are available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (CC BY-SA 4.0), the only exceptions being the names and logos of the Catrobat project (including, e.g., Catrobat, Catroid, Catty, Pocket Code, Paintroid, Pocket Paint), which are copyrighted by and trademarks of the Catrobat project and cannot be used in derivative work. See http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ for a human-readable summary of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License.
