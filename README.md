A tool for converting Scratch projects into Catrobat programs.

Catrobat is a visual programming language and set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and mobile browsers. Catrobat programs can be written by using the Catroid programming system on Android phones and tablets, using Catroid, or Catty for iPhones.

#Setup for Debian (Wheezy 7.x):

* First of all you have to refresh your package lists via:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```
* Now install python (if not already installed) (minimum allowed version 2.7):
```sh
sudo apt-get install python
```
* Install sox via aptitude (needed for sound conversion):
```sh
sudo apt-get install sox
```
* Jython 2.7 requires java version 1.8 or later. To determine the currently installed java version run the following command on your shell:
```sh
java -version
```
* Now, download jython e.g. by using wget (at least version 2.7):
```sh
wget http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-installer/2.7.0/jython-installer-2.7.0.jar
```
* To install jython issue the following command and fill in the parameters listed below:
```sh
sudo java -jar jython-installer-2.7.0.jar --console
[...]
Please select your language [E/g] >>> E
Do you want to read the license agreement now ? [y/N] >>> y
[...]
Do you accept the license agreement ? [Y/n] >>> Y
The following installation types are available:
1. All (everything, including sources)
2. Standard (core, library modules, demos and examples, documentation)
3. Minimum (core)
9. Standalone (a single, executable .jar)
Please select the installation type [ 1 /2/3/9] >>> 2
Do you want to install additional parts ? [y/N] >>> N
Do you want to exclude parts from the installation ? [y/N] >>> N
Please enter the target directory >>> /usr/jython
Unable to find directory /usr/jython, create it ? [Y/n] >>> Y
Please enter the java home directory (empty for using the current java runtime) >>>
[...]
Please confirm copying of files to directory /usr/jython [Y/n] >>> Y
[...]
Do you want to show the contents of README ? [y/N] >>> y
[...]
Please press Enter to proceed >>>
Congratulations! You successfully installed Jython 2.7 to directory /usr/jython.
```

* Install git via apt-get:
```sh
sudo apt-get install git
```
* Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Catrobat/ScratchToCatrobat.git
```
* Go to the ScratchToCatrobat directory:
```sh
cd ScratchToCatrobat
```
* Open jython's registry file and change the following line:
```sh
python.security.respectJavaAccessibility = true
```
to:
```sh
python.security.respectJavaAccessibility = false
```

* (This step is *optional*, but *highly recommended* for developers.) For your convenience, we'd recommend you to create a new (empty) local custom config file called "environment.ini" in the "config" directory. It automatically inherits from the original config file "default.ini" and is ignored by the ".gitignore" settings. Thus, every parameter you will later define in your "environment.ini" file will automatically overwrite the corresponding parameter coming from the "default.ini" file, i.e. *new parameters* *must be defined* in the "default.ini" file *at first* (due to compatibility reasons) and thereafter in your local "environment.ini" file. Keep in mind that it does not make sense to put in new parameters into the "environment.ini" that do not exist in the "default.ini", since your local "environment.ini" file is not part of the Git repository as already mentioned before.
```sh
touch ./config/environment.ini
```

* Make the converter script executable:
```sh
chmod +x ./run
```

* You can now start the conversion process, e.g. by issuing the following command:
```sh
./run http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10205819/ ./data/output
```

Here, the first parameter tells the script which scratch project should be converted.
The second parameter (optional) represents the (absolute or relative) path to the output folder where the converted Catrobat program is finally stored.

For more details on how to use the script, please execute the following line:
```sh
./run --help
```
